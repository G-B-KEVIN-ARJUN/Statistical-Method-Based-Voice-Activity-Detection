# Statistical-Method-Based-Voice-Activity-Detection
A statistical model based voice activity detector has been made, where the decision rule is derived from the likelihood ratio test (LRT) by estimating unknown parameters using the decision-directed method. Hang-over scheme based on the hidden Markov model (HMM) is applied for window initial boundary smoothening
